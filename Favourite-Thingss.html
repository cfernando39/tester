		<h2>Music</h2>
		<p>When I was little girl, I would always sing and dance around the house. I would (sometimes) know what the lyrics were; other times I would just make up my own lyrics.tgyuhjsdkvf wofneo nwoefwe ewufhwfeowijweoi jeoijoedjqiowjdqwodjqowidj qwoidj qoiwjd qowdj qowdij qwodjqo wdijqodijq doq dwiehsdfdkfhasfh asdjckdjcsdahdwficierficnsdeirfeic asdjc sdcasdca sjdcnjsdncsjnc sdkcnksdn cksn dnc kjdncsksndcakdncaksnccndsknsd would (sometimes) know what the lyrics were; other times I would just make up my own lyrics.tgyuhjsdkvf wofneo nwoefwe ewufhwfeowijweoi jeoijoedjqiowjdqwodjqowidj qwoidj qoiwjd qowdj qowdij qwodjqo wdijqodijq doq dwiehsdfdkfhasfh asdjckdjcsdahdwficierficnsdeirfeic asdjc sdcasdca sjdcnjsdncsjnc sdkcnksdn cksn dnc kjdncsk would (sometimes) know what the lyrics were; other times I would just make up my own lyrics.tgyuhjsdkvf wofneo nwoefwe ewufhwfeowijweoi jeoijoedjqiowjdqwodjqowidj qwoidj qoiwjd qowdj qowdij qwodjqo wdijqodijq doq dwiehsdfdkfhasfh asdjckdjcsdahdwficierficnsdeirfeic asdjc sdcasdca sjdcnjsdncsjnc sdk</p>

		<h2>Bollywood Music</h2>
		<p>I first got into Bollywood music when my family and I went to my dad's friend's house for dinner. I was probably 5 years old at the time. When we arrived, they had a movie playing on their tv, and I was instantly intrigued. Not because it was a movie, but because there was singing and dancing. This was the first time I had seen a movie that had both singing and dancing at the same time. sdkcsdlcsdcwoicndncaksdcnaohnsd owehf oasdcjnds aisdfyhj mhg dfghjkl fghjk vbn vbnm fghjk vbnm rtyuk.
